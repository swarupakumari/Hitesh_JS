<!-- 
In simple terms:

Without the bind method, an event listener only has access to the context (or this) of the element that triggers the event (like a button in this case). So, in your example, the handleClick event listener only has the button's context (this refers to the button itself).

Using the bind method, we can set the this context to a different object, allowing us to access the context where the event listener was created, not just the button's context."
